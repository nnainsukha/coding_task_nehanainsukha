## Coding Tasks

Instructions to setup and run the scripts on your machine.

If you have Python already installed in your machine, you can go ahead and run it in terminal, but if you dont have it and you dont want to install it, I am also attaching the links that you can just copy and paste in your browser to run both the programs.



# 1. First Task: Generating reports every minute using data of last one minute

   link to run first script: https://repl.it/@NehaNainsukha/oneminutetaskpothi#main.py
   
   copy and paste in the browser and hit run, it will automatically install required libraries and modules and wait for a minute to let it 	generate the first report.

**a. How to run it in Terminal**

Prerequisite: Python installed on machine

This program uses SSECLIENT module.This is a Python client library for iterating over http Server Sent Event (SSE) streams .The SSEClient class accepts a url on init, and is then an iterator over messages coming from the server.

If you do not have this library installed, first install it using pip install sseclient

-Navigate the terminal to the directory where the script is located using the cd command.

-Type python3 oneminutetask.py in the terminal to execute the script.

-Wait for a minute to let it generate the first report.

-It will keep on generating reports until you interrupt it using keyboard interrupt(ctrl+c) since its a continuous straming API.


# 2. Bonus Task: Generating reports every minute using data of last five minutes

	link to run first script: https://repl.it/@NehaNainsukha/bonustaskpothi#main.py
	
	copy and paste in the browser and hit run, it will automatically install required libraries and modules and wait for a minute to 		let it generate the first report.
